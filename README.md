    - Download the correct .zip for your platform (for Windows v0.26.2.0 use BepInEx_x64_5.4.22.0.zip, for v0.26.1.0 use BepInEx_x86_5.4.22.0.zip)

3. Put the .dll file(s) into your game directory, inside BepInEx\plugins.


## Mod Info

### SexTrainingFilter

Updates the interface for home Sex-Training - you may now click on the info display for an MC part (e.g. Hands). This will filter the character views to only include species which can contribute to raising the max level for that part.

### BugFixes

Fixes for bugs that's I've bothered to implement. Currently includes:
 - Fix pussy interest change for farm pairs to be based on if the partner has a pussy (originally, based on if partner has a cock)
 - Fix ratio of poor/meduim/rich customers for brothel shows
